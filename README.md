### AMTG

It is recommended you install typescript & gulp globally:

``` sudo npm install gulp tsd -g ```

Installation:

``` git clone git@github.com:OR13/AMTG.git ```

``` npm install && bower install && tsd install```

Local development:

``` gulp serve ```

Production build:

``` gulp build ```

Deploy production build to github pages:

``` gulp gh-deploy ```


I recommend you use an IDE with good support for TypeScript and Sass:

[Atom](https://atom.io/)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


This code is based of the most excellent: [Swiip generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular)
